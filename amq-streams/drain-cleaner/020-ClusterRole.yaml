  # When certificate reloading is enabled, Strimzi needs to be able to get, list and watch the Secret with the
  # certificate to detect any changes to it. The RBAC allows it to watch only one Secret with given name. If your
  # certificate Secret has a custom name, you need to modify this Role accordingly.
